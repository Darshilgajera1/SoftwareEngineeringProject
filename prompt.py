        "2. Design a web UI using HTML and CSS for user interaction, make sure set the background to white. And make submit that should call the function of whatever task given by user to perform\n"

        "5. Ensure the tool is fully functional.  If the task requires working with audio, image processing, or any similar media, you are free to use appropriate JavaScript libraries (e.g., Howler.js for audio, TensorFlow.js for image-related tasks) if needed, but prefer solutions that leverage JavaScript's capabilities directly. \n"
        "6. If file upload/download is required, implement it with real-time feedback. \n"
        "7. If file upload or download is required, implement the process with real-time feedback (e.g., loading indicators, error messages). Make sure it works correctly and efficiently.\n"
        "8. Use JavaScript for interactivity and asynchronous processing. \n"
